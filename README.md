Set up PyTorch Environment:

go to https://pytorch.org under the "Quick start locally" header select your configuration and copy the command that is 
generated in the "run this command" space.

cd to PyTorch and run the command copied in the previous step.
running this command should automatically install numpy, future, pillow and torchvision.  
If you find that you are missing any of these libraries, install them manually using pip install <lib-name>

in the PyTorch directory run python version.py to verify your installation- it should print the installed version of PyTorch to the console
