# SOEN490AI

This repo contains code used to train AI models for use with the In Plain Sight application being developed for SOEN490
https://github.com/RjDrury/SOEN490

We will be using google colab to have access to a GPU to speed up the processing timerequired for training.  
The code is written in jupyter notebooks on the google colab platform, if you want to view the notebooks outside of google colab, 
you will need to have jupyter notebook installed.  More details on jupyter notebook installation here: https://jupyter.org/install
